# Unhandled Asynchronous Errors in Node.js Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js servers: neglecting to properly handle errors in asynchronous operations.  The server might appear to function normally, but requests could fail silently due to uncaught exceptions within asynchronous callbacks.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file contains a simple HTTP server that performs an asynchronous operation.  If this operation fails, the error is logged to the console, but the client receives no response.  This is bad for user experience and debugging.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.  It uses a `try...catch` block within the asynchronous operation's callback to handle potential errors. This ensures that even if an asynchronous operation fails, the server sends an appropriate error response to the client instead of silently failing.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the repository directory in your terminal
3. Run `node bug.js` to see the buggy version.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js` to observe the improved error handling.
